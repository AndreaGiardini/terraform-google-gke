# GKE Regional Public Cluster

This example creates a Regional Public GKE Cluster with some sane defaults.

## How do you run these examples?

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 2.x) and in your `PATH`.
1. Open `variables.tf`, set the environment variables specified at the top of the file, and fill in any other variables that
   don't have a default.
1. Run `terraform get`.
1. Run `terraform plan`.
1. If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply`.
